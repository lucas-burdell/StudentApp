# StudentApp
This is an application to help Blackburn students by organizing various sources of information relevant to students.

## This application aims to:
1. Make the announcements more accessible. Ex. Students could sort announcements by category and they could be uploaded as they come rather than once a day.
2. Load a transcript and show the majors and minors a student has credit towards.
3. Show all of the clubs on campus with meeting times and members listed with a link to join.
4. Automatically fill google calendar with class information retrieved from the portal.
5. Provide a map of the campus and display locations of classrooms relavent to the student.

## Libraries used
This application currently utilizes the [HtmlUnit](http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/) library - a "GUI-less browser for Java programs" - to scrape data from the student portal web interface.
